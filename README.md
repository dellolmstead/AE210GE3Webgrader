# AE210GE3Webgrader
Autograder for GE3 that is web hosted so cadets can submit an excel file, and it will read it and give feedback on whether it meets the requirements or not.
Goal is to have a website that cadets upload a JET11 .xlsm file to and it grades it and gives feedback that matches the autograder results. The truth source for requirements is the design project RFP, and the aircraft created must meet the threshold requirements and be a viable aircraft.
