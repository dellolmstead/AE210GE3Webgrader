
% GE3 Autograder: Grades AE210 Jet10 Excel submissions, logs feedback, and optionally exports Blackboard-compatible scores.


%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% AE210 GE3 Autograder Script – Fall 2025
%
% Description:
% This script automates grading for AE210 preliminary Design Project 
% submissions (GE3) by processing Jet10 Excel files (*.xlsm). It evaluates 
% multiple design criteria, generates detailed feedback, and outputs both a
% summary log and an optional Blackboard-compatible grade import file.
%
% Key Features:
% - Supports both single-file and batch-folder grading via GUI
% - Parallel-safe execution using MATLAB's parpool
% - Robust Excel reading with fallback for missing data
% - Detailed feedback log per cadet with scoring breakdown
% - Optional export to Blackboard offline grade format (SMART_TEXT)
% - Histogram visualization of score distribution
%
% Inputs:
% - User-selected Excel file or folder of files
%
% Outputs:
% - Text log file: textout_<timestamp>.txt
% - Histogram of scores
% - Optional Blackboard CSV: GE3_Blackboard_Offline_<timestamp>.csv
%
% Embedded Functions:
% - gradeCadet: Grades a single cadet's file and returns score and feedback
% - loadAllJet10Sheets: Loads all required sheets from a Jet10 Excel file
% - safeReadMatrix: Robustly reads numeric data from Excel, with fallback to readcell
% - cell2sub: Converts Excel cell references (e.g., 'G4') to row/col indices
% - sub2excel: Converts row/col indices back to Excel cell references
% - logf: Appends formatted text to a log string
% - selectRunMode: GUI for selecting single file or folder mode
% - promptAndGenerateBlackboardCSV: Dialog + export to Blackboard SMART_TEXT format
